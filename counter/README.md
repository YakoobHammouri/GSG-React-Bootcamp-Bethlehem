# Counter React App
In this example, ***useState*** is used to create a state variable count and a ***function setCount*** that can be used to update the value of count. The initial value of count is set to 1.

The ***onClick*** event handler is used to update the state of the component when the user clicks the button. When the button is clicked, the ***updateCounter***   function is called with the new value of count, causing the component to re-render with the updated state.

The ***useEffect*** is a hook that allows you to perform side effects in function components. Side effects include things like fetching data from an API, updating the document title, or setting up event listeners.
